title: I'm an Asian, but I'm NOT a virus!
---

In light the Anti-Asian racism brought about due to COVID-19, New Yorker Barbara Yau feared for the safety of her 14-year old daughter, Kyra.  Rather than fall into patterns of anxiety and anger the two thought about ways that they could help inform and hopefully alleviate some of the negative sentiment.  As a donation to MOCAâ€™s OneWorld Collection, Barbara and Krya have submitted a poster that Kyra (Instagram @ Skye_arte) created to deter the acts of racism and inform victims how to report such incidents.  Barbara has been in contact with local politicians, community leaders, and business owners about putting these posters up in the community.
